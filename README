# Addict
I am not an addict. :stuck_out_tongue:
This is the name of the Inversion of Control (IoC) container I am developing for learning purposes.

## Functions
Addict in the current state is just a basic IoC container.
The binding between the dependencies is done via code.
It supports modules to provide a separation of the context you are working on.

## Usage
If you want to use this project have a look at the tests.
I have written some tests for the current state of the container.

## Tasks
- [] Add the functionality to request a singleton or new instance from the container
- [] Inject values for primitive types
- [] Support Life cycle methods for objects
